						<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
						<p>The creation of new products and updating of the existing ones is key for continuous business success. Until very recently that process was very slow: designers had to hand draw sketches, prototypes were manually machined and once the prototype was finished and approved, manufacturing lines had to be adjusted to make it at scale.</p>
						<p>The introduction of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Numerical Control (CNC) revolutionized such processes and significantly reduced time to market. Together with inexpensive offshore labour, that resulted in standard products made very cheap once the scale is big enough.<br>
							The best example is IKEA which has a very limited product range at a very aggressive price point. Even for relatively large businesses competing with such a giant is hard. Therefore, one has to find other ways to stay competitive rather than rely on economies of scale.</p>
						<p>Inspiration can be taken from smaller businesses which find their competitive advantage by producing niche products â€” ie. companies who fit the needs better of a smaller user group. For a larger company built around economies of scale the latter is hard to achieve because having a, possibly magnitude, larger product catalogue could break their processes.</p>
						<p>In this series of blog posts, we address how recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods can be employed in the design stage to scale the process. We start by connecting all the tools to increase our range of dining tables by offering unique designs of their legs.</p>

						<p><b>Artificial Intelligence and CAD</b></p>
						<p>
							Artificial intelligence and machine learning are being successful at a wide variety of tasks starting with object detection in images, autonomous driving, X-ray analysis to beating humans in Go, Poker and Starcraft II. On the creative side, AI methods can help to source music for our games and movies, generate abstract images.<br>
							Recently, Autodesk has released their generative design solutions which allow making use of machine learning algorithms to optimise the design to specifications and costs. Although the efficient product is tremendously important, that is only part of the problem. In this series, we will look into how AI can be used to design unique products in terms of style at scale.<br>
							Regarding our tools, on the AI side, we will use Python programming language for its flexibility and vast array of libraries available. Regarding CAD, our tool of choice is Fusion 360 because of its simple integration with Python, high availability and ease of use.<br>
							The goal of this post is to connect all the pieces and explore randomly generating dining table legs and then shortlisting the interesting ones. The leg design is restricted to one which could be turned with a CNC lathe from a square block.
